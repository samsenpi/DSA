## Introduction 📚

In this repository, you will find implementations and explanations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing efficient and scalable software solutions.

## Data Structures 📊

### Stack 📚

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It supports two main operations: `push` (adds an element to the top of the stack) and `pop` (removes the top element from the stack).

### Queue 🚶‍♂️

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. It supports two main operations: `enqueue` (adds an element to the rear of the queue) and `dequeue` (removes the front element from the queue).

### List 📝

A list is a collection of elements where each element has a position or index. It allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements.

### Linked List 🔗

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. It allows for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion operations.

### Max-Heap ⭐

A max-heap is a complete binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. It is commonly used in priority queue implementations.

## Algorithms 🔍

### Searching Algorithms 🔎

Searching algorithms are used to find an element within a collection of elements. Common searching algorithms include linear search, binary search, and various tree-based searches like depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).

### Expression Delimiter 🧮

Expression delimiter algorithms are used to validate and evaluate expressions containing delimiters such as parentheses, braces, and brackets. They ensure that expressions are properly balanced and syntactically correct.
